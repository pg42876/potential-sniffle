class StandardScaler:
    """
    Standardize features by centering the mean to 0 and unit variance.
    The standard score of an instance is calculated by:
        z = (x - u) / s
    where u is the mean of the training data and s is the standard deviation.
    Standardizing data is often necessary before training many machine
    learning models to avoid problems like exploding/vanishing gradients and
    feature dominance.
    Attributes
    ----------
    _mean : numpy array of shape (n_features, )
        The mean of each feature in the training set.
    _var : numpy array of shape (n_features, )
        The variance of each feature in the training set.
